Hey there, I am a Ph.D student at Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (IIT Gandhinagar) working in the NanoDC lab under the supervision of Prof. Joycee Mekie. 
I work in the area of energy efficient computing. I have worked on the design of approximate circuits for both integer and floating point operations.
I have also started looking into the field of approximate architectures which support approximate computing.
