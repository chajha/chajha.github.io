Hey there, I am a Ph.D student at Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (IIT Gandhinagar) working in the NanoDC lab under the supervision of <a href="https://iitgn.ac.in/faculty/electrical/joycee.htm">Prof. Joycee Mekie</a>. 
I work in the area of energy efficient computing. I have worked on the design of approximate circuits for both integer and floating point operations.
I have also started looking into the field of approximate architectures which support approximate computing.

I received my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering from National Institute of Technology Meghalaya in 2015. I spent a semester in 2016 at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. I also spent a semester of 2017 at Intel, Bangalore and was working on On Chip Power Distribution Networks.
  I am currently interning with <a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~omutlu/">Prof. Onur Mutlu</a> at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.
